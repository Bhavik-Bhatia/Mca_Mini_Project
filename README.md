This is the Mini project for MCA, semester 3.

#Login Details

1)Student Login is done using Firestore db while Admin Login is done using Firebase Auth.
2)Because whenever you use Auth you get ID of the current Instance but as we have provided a feature to Admin to add students, as Admin is logged In we won't get the
ID of students as Instance is of the Admin.
